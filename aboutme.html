    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>-In 2002, after high school, I attended the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, there I had 
        aspirations to get a degree in Computer Science as well as Spanish. While I decided
        to change courses and pursue a entrepreneurial path, I never lost the passion for technology. 
        I also kept up with my spanish skills and love overcoming the language barrier
        with native speakers. While still living in Oshkosh I found myself in the service industry 
        again, and realized developing customer relations was something I had been missing. For 10 years
        I was partnered in a bar/restaurant which allowed me to be my own boss and work with a 
        tight group of motivated individuals that quickly became family. While this was a dream 
        job for me I knew it was not my long term goal. My wife, two kids and I decided to move to 
        Arkansas and get away from the extreme colds of Wisconsin winters, while simultaneously 
        pursuing our homesteading goals. In my current position I am working for a large scale 
        manufacturer while repursuing my tech based goals. We have also begun raising chickens 
        for the eggs and pest control with plans to expand into other livestock such as 
        cattle, pigs, goats and a large scale garden for our use as well as the surrounding communities.

    <h3>Career Goals</h3>
    <p>While I love anything involving Technology, specifically computers and how to get them to assist me and others in every day applications, my real goals
        lie in the blockchain sector. I have spent a many hours studying the solidity language and have aspirations to become a smart contract developer on
        an Ethereum based public blockchain.
    </p>
    <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
    <p>Though most of my current training is involving tech and being "in doorsy", I love working outside on our homestead. This is coupled with an 
        overall passion of physical fitness, which I definitely need to keep up with my 12 year old son, my 8 year old daughter, and my beautiful wife who happens to be
        a personal trainer.
